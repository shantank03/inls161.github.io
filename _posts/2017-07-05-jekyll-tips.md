## Using this site we will explore:

2. how to avoid common problems with using Jekyll;
3. how to import your content from WordPress, use your own domain name, and blog in your favorite editor;
4. how to theme in Jekyll, with Liquid templating examples;
5. a couple of Jekyll 2.0’s new features, including Sass and CoffeeScript support and collections.

Jekyll is fast, simple, minimal and does not require a database (along with uber convenient hosting)! This is a very useful tool to know.
